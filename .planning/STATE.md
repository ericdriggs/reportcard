## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Don't rename code internals (unnecessary churn, DB still uses "pipeline" terminology)
- Redirect old URLs instead of removing (avoid breaking existing bookmarks/links)
- Group by org at company level (user wants to see org context when viewing company-wide)
